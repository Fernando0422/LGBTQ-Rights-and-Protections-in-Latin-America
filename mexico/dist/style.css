/* Along with that, there are no federal laws that legalize same-sex marriage leaving it up to the individual states to determine whether or not it will recognize equal unions. Just as recently as September 2021, the state of Sonora had legalized same-sex marriage which made up only 2/3 of Mexico states to legalize and recognize same-sex marriage. Also, Mexico had passed the federal law that includes homophobia as a form of discrimination preventing public and private sectors from actively discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community. While the country is entering a more progressive and tolerant state, there still needs to be more reform and protection for the LGBTQ+ community." */

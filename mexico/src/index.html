              value="Mexico is a country that promotes anti-discrimination, however, homophobia and transphobia remain relevant and prevail. This can be seen throughout the alarmingly high numbers of murders that have occurred in recent years purely based on people's gender identity and sexual orientation. From 2010 to 2013 there were 288 murders with true numbers being much higher due to unreliable investigations and data collection. Over 50% of LGBTQ+ members had felt that they had been discriminated against and 70% believed that the country did not respect their rights. It is also important to note that the policing system in Mexico has also not been intolerant of the LGBTQ+ community and has gone to the point where it would not look into certain investigations if the victim is a part of the LGBTQ+ community." width="20" position="-10.5 -.75 -10" rotation="0 1 0"></a-text>

              value="Along with that, there are no federal laws that legalize same-sex marriage leaving it up to the individual states to determine whether or not it will recognize equal unions. Just as recently as September 2021, the state of Sonora had legalized same-sex marriage which made up only 2/3 of Mexico states to legalize and recognize same-sex marriage. Also, Mexico had passed the federal law that includes homophobia as a form of discrimination preventing public and private sectors from actively discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community. While the country is entering a more progressive and tolerant state, there still needs to be more reform and protection for the LGBTQ+ community." width="20" position="9.5 -.75 -8" rotation="0 -90 0"></a-text>

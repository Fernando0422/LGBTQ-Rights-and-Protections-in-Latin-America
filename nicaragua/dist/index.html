              value="Nicaragua has no protection for the LGBTQ plus community with the article 204 of the Nicaraguan Penal Code criminlizing same-sex relationships and prosecutes anyone who campaigns for LGBTQ plus rights or sexual health services. According to several human rights organizations, article 204 goes against many international human rights and contradicts itself. Many times, politicians use the LGBTQ plus community to seem more progressive and liberal, but once the person consolidates power, they go against the very same people they claim to side with.

              value="It has gone so far that specifically trans women have been targeted by government agencies and were kidnapped and brutally beaten for no reason other than their gender identity. This abuse of power stems from Nicaraguaâ€˜s lack of protection and rights for its very own citizens and prevents any persecution against those who commit violent acts. As of December 2018, many NGOs have been stripped of their legal standing except for those who support the Nicaraguan government. This has led too many LGBTQ plus citizens to be hunted down and exiled out of the country. " width="20" position="9.5 2 -8" rotation="0 -90 0"></a-text>

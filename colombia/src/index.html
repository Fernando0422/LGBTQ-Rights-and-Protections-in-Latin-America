              value="In Colombia, LGBTQ+ individuals have accomplished a lot over the past 20 years. The community was formally recognized by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia which was the first in the world to explicitly include LGBTQ+ individuals. Along with that, the country did allow same-sex couples to marry have the right to adopt children. Everything seems to be all right right? The answer is no. While on paper it seems that Colombia has progressive views on the LGBTQ+ community, in practice it gives the community very little protection and rights. This is why Colombia is the 2nd most dangerous country in Latin America for LGBTQ+ people because the country has not addressed the number of murders and assaults that have occurred. Even though the President of Colombia (Ivan Duque) stated that he had the utmost respect for the LGBTQ+ community, his government is made up of conservative and evangelical groups who pushed harmful stereotypes. This in turn allows them to gain more influence as Colimba is a predominantly catholic country and be able to pass legislation to actively discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community." width="20" position="-10.5 1 -10" rotation="0 0 0"></a-text>

As of December 15, 2020, the President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, signed an agreement with the US to implement an asylum cooperative agreement; however, El Salvador does not provide proper asylum for people in the LGBTQ+ community. El Salvador does not provide proper protection for its LGBTQ+ citizens and let alone for asylum seekers. LBGTQ+ people have faced illegal arrests, torture, inhumane treatment, and other forms of abuse mostly committed by the very police that are supposed to protect the countries citizens. Just like many other countries' presidents, Bukele, El Salvador's president, seemed progressive while running for president; however, once in office, it took a hard turn. His blatant homophobia and opposition towards equal marriage have had a mass effect on the public perception of the LGBTQ+ community. For the country to truly create change for LGBTQ+ citizens, it would have to ensure that criminals who commit hate crimes and discrimination are properly tried and held accountable for their actions in the court of law. Along with that, providing adequate health care and practicing anti-discrimination will further lead to the destigmatization of the LGBTQ+ community.

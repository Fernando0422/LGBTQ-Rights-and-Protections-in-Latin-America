                     In Brazil, many laws protect its LGBTQ+ citizens, however, many times it is ignored. In just 2018 alone, more than 420 LGBTQ+ members had been murdered making it one of the most violent countries in the world for LGBTQ+ people. Similar to many other countries, it is up to the individual states to determine their stance on discrimination towards sexual orientation and gender identity. There is no federal discrimination law that protects LGBTQ+ people leaving many citizens endangered and exposed to violence. Along with that, the influence of Jair Bolsonaro, the President of Brazil, has altered how the public perceives the LGBTQ+ community. He is actively homophobic and has said in previous interviews that he would rather have a dead son rather than a gay son. This homophobia only pushes the narrative that it is okay to discriminate against this community and future pushes the false stigmatization of the LBGTQ+ community as a whole.

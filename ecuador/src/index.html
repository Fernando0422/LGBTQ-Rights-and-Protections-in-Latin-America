                     There are current laws that are written to protect and defend LGBTQ+ people; however, they are never seen in practice. In Ecuador, there is a legal framework in written format, but its very own judges, police, and other government agencies actively go against it and make it essentially useless. This has led to over 70% of LGBTQ+ people reporting they have felt discrimination due to their gender identity or sexual orientation. In the Ecuadorian constitution, there is Article 11, Section 2 that has an anti-discrimination law that protects LGBTQ+ individuals, but it immediately contradicts itself by the law in Article 67 which states that marriage is a union between men and women preventing and discriminating against LGBTQ+ people in the very same document where it protects them. It also does not help that judges actually can use religious exemption for cases where it pertains to LGBTQ+ violence. The President also does not help in protecting LGBTQ+ people as it continually condemns sexual rights and continually expresses his opposition towards equal marriage and adoption.

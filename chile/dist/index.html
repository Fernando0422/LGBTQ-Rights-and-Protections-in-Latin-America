              value="In 2019, Chile had performed a progressive move to seem more accepting bypassing the Ley de Identidad de Genero (the law for gender identity) which provided legal protections for people's gender identity. This is law states that people over the age of 14 can change their gender identity and names on a legal document. While it may seem that Chile is approaching a more progressive and accepting government, Article 373 of the Chilean Penal Code proves this idea to be wrong. Article 373 is the law of morality and good customs which is the #1 law used to justify detaining an LGBTQ+ individual. This is why LGBTQ people regularly experience harassment from the police force who are meant to protect them, but rather justify their discrimination through legislation that was passed by the Chilean government." width="20" position="-10.5 1 -10" rotation="0 0 0"></a-text>

              value="On June 28, 2021, Maria Ignacia, a trans woman, was detained for unknown reasons. From this, police took matters into their own hands and forced her to perform oral copulation on the police officers while then proceeding to humiliate and physically abuse her. After this attack, Maria tried to go to the hospital to help with her injuries, but right after being admitted, she was denied service by the doctor leaving her stranded to deal with her injuries on her own. Article 373 damages the LGBTQ+ community and should be eliminated from legislation as it allows for people to actively discriminate against the community causing further damage.

              value="In Bolivia, several systematic issues in the government actively discriminate agaist its LGBTQ community as a whole. This has been seen with law enforcement using their authority to force trans women to endure dangerous situations that force them to risk their lives to survive. Bolivia fails to protect its LGBTQ+ citizens by disregarding cases of murders and violence towards people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. There is a law that protects people from discrimination, but the government has failed in enacting it to reduce discrimination and hate crimes as a whole. Over the past two decades, there have been over 30 murders, with none of the perpetrators receiving just punishment. Mini Brittany was a trans woman who was brutally murdered in the morning with no one being identified or brought to trial even though active witnesses were seeing the perpetrators dispose of her lifeless body. This is not the only case where people collectively attacked and murdered an LGBTQ-identifying person. In March of 2012, a mob of 400 people 'ortured, burned, and lynched'a trans women. Even after her death, police identified the victim as a 'an dressed as a [woman]'. In a study conducted by Conexion Fondo de Emancipacion, 11% of LGBTQ-identifying students had been expelled from their school because of their sexual orientation, 12% were denied from an educational institution, 48% had been discriminated against by parents of students, and 53% were discriminated by teachers. Bolivia is a beautiful country; however, the government and police forces need to enact its already established laws to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ people and their citizens." width="20" position="-8.5 -.75 -9" rotation="0 15 0"></a-text>

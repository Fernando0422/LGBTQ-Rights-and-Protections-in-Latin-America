              value="Panama has one of the most thriving economies in all of Central America, however, its legislation towards the LGBTQ+ community has gone backward in recent years. LGBTQ+ people have very little to no protection against the police which has been a large part of discrimination and violence against the community. Same-sex marriage is illegal due to the family code which is a legal text that outlines the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. There are currently no federal anti-discrimination policies, meaning that organizations and companies can actively discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community." width="20" position="-10.5 1 -10" rotation="0 0 0"></a-text>

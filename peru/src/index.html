              value="In Peru, many LGBTQ+ people have felt discrimination or violence in some sort of way. In a survey of 12,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 29, 63% had felt that they were a victim of discrimination or violence with less than 5% filing a complaint to the police from the assault. Thereâ€™s an immense lack of data that needs to be represented meaning that the actual numbers may be higher than initially thought.

              value="Thereâ€™s ample evidence that suggests there has been an increase in violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community with a lack of protection from the government or police agencies. Peru has yet to comply with the inter-American court of human rights to recognize LGBTQ+ marriage and the alteration of people's gender identity on official documents.

              value="In 1979, Cuban made legal changes for the LGBTQ+ community by making being gay no longer a crime. While this may seem really good and somewhat progressive for the time that the legislation was changed; however, under Article 303a of the Cubas Penal Code, public manifestations of homosexuality remain illegal. This can be seen as it has made any public marches illegal preventing queer voices to be heard. There is also a large and loud social stigma regarding the LGBTQ+ community that the largely catholic population uses to actively discriminate against people. This generational resentment can be traced back to when the Castro family would send LGBTQ+ people to labor camps to torture and kill in a way to cleanse Cuba. The only form of LGBTQ+ movements that are ever able to form are those formed by the Cuban government. These government-funded and formed movements prevent any true change from occurring and dismiss and refuse to acknowledge the international week of LGBTQ+ celebrations. This form of mass censorship is nothing new to the government as it is common for citizens to not have a reliable internet connection which in turn has led to people not being able to communicate outside the country's fortified digital walls." width="20" position="-10.5 1 -10" rotation="0 0 0"></a-text>

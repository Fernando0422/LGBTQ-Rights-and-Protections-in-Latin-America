              Argentina is one of the most progressive countries in the world in regards to LGBTQ+ rights and protection laws. Not only was it the first country to legalize both same-sex marriage and adoption, but was the first country in the world to permit people to change their gender identity without the authorization by a physician or judge. Along with that, in regards to trans representation, it implemented a quota that ensures at least 1% of public sector jobs are held by trans-identifying individuals. With regards to specific laws, Bill No. 26.791 changed the criminal code to punish people who committed a crime on someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity to serve up to life in prison.

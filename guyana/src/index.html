                     In Guyana, it is the only Latin American country where same-sex sexual activities have been criminalized it is one of the last ex-British colonies to have this law in place. This form of incrimination has encouraged citizens to continuously harass and discriminate against the LGBTQ plus community. The laws are so strict, cross-dressing is forbidden. Which stands for my life that was an act in 1893. Guyana has not demonstrated any progression to reform its legislation, how tiring any progress to be made. In the countries entire history, it is only permitted one gay pride parade which happened back in June 2018 with the government granting permission for this movement. However, there are anti-discrimination laws such as the Discrimination Act which sought to eliminate discrimination in training, employment, recruitment, and professional body. Well, it may seem McKaena has made a progressive movement towards preventing discrimination, this act does not include any form of anti-discrimination towards sexual orientation or gender identity leaving the LGBTQ plus community vulnerable to discrimination and violence.

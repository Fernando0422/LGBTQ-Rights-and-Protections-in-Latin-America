              value="There is a lack of protection for the LGBTQ plus community and power, mostly due to the conservative attitudes that prevail in the country along with the dominant Roman Catholic religion that has a great influence on the people's perception of the LGBTQ+ community. The education minister has actually banned all classes regarding sexual diversity and even stated that he would help burn all the books related to the subject.

Even the president has criticized the LGBTQ+ community by stating he would rather shoot himself rather than see his son marry a man. The majority of the time people use the excuse of not wanting to teach their children about being gay trans or lesbian as a choice and rather say they are not homophobic, but believe that the LGBTQ plus community is not normal and should not be included.

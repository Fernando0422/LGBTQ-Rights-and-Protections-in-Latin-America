              value="Guatemala does not have any civil laws that explicitly protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Because of this, there have been several instances where people have been hate crimes or killed because of how they identify. This is especially true when it comes to trans-identifying individuals as there are no laws that permit anyone to change their gender on any official document. This means that anytime a trans-identifying person has to present official documentation, they have a high risk of being discriminated against and risk their safety due to improper documentation systems in Guatemala.

              value="Hate crimes for trans women have especially been high with two of OTRANS Reinas de la Noche (an organization that brings resources to trans women in Guatemala) leaders being murdered in June of 2020. Along with that, the government has done nothing to address this and in fact, proposed Initiative 5278 was a bill that was going to punish people who commit hate crimes based on gender identity and sexual orientation was thrown out from the congressional committee without it ever even making it to a vote. The police system also does not address hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community and continually misidentify trans women as 'men dressed in women's clothes'.

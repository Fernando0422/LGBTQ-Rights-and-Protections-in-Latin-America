              value="Venezuela has become a country that would rather silence those and continue with oppression rather than hear those voices and alter society. This can be seen with LGBTQ+ rights advocates receiving numerous death threats after the murder of trans women. The reason people can get away with discriminating against the LGBTQ+ community is that they use Article 565 of the Organic Code of Military which states that it is legal to criminalize someone based on their sexual orientation. This renders the LBGTQ+ community to fear in silence as simply their presence will have them arrested and ruin their lives completely.

              value="This can be seen throughout the country, especially in Caracas the capital where trans women face countless acts of violence against their very existence. It goes to show that without any protections in place, people's lives are at risk with those who lost them never experiencing justice as the perpetrators are never found or plead not guilty by a corrupt judicial system developed to go against the LGBTQ+ community.

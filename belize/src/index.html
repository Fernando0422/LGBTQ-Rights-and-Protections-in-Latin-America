Before 2016, Belize was just like most Latin American countries that continually discriminated against the LGBTQ+ community through laws that promoted this homophobia. In August 2016, however, everything would change with Kenneth Benjamin who was the chief justice of Belize ruled that Section 53 of the criminal code was, in fact, unconstitutional and actively discriminated against the LGBTQ+ community. Fortunately, the Belizean government agreed with this ruling and began the process of decriminalizing same-sex relationships and implementing more rights and protections for the community. Of course, just like many Latin American countries, the Roman Catholic Church had strong opinions towards this change, however, their filing ended up failing and led them to withdraw their appeal.

              value="Puerto Rico has recently changed drastically in just a few months. For the first time, it permitted a state of emergency over the gender violence that has occurred on the island. Gender violence is something that many Latin American countries have faced in recent years with very few countries doing something against it. This is especially important for the trans community of Puerto Rico as trans women specifically have been victims of abuse and murder simply for identifying how they wanted. However, before this state of emergency, Puerto Rico still had many issues. For instance, the police departments would never really investigate any hate crimes or assault cases that permitted people to discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community and create a stigma around people in this community.

              value="One such case was the murder of Alexa Luciano who was brutally murdered after a viral post of her going to the restroom was uploaded to the internet which lead to her being shot and beaten by a group of men. Her case would be left uninvestigated at first, but Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny brought attention to the case which led to the case being reopened. Puerto Rico suffers the same situation that many other countries face in that the people have the rights on paper, but in action, it is ignored.

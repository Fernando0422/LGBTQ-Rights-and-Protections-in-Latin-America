                     Out of all the Latin American countries, Costa Rica is the first and so far only country to federally make same-sex marriage legal. This is a stark difference with other countries either fully making it illegal or allowing individual states to determine the legality. While this is a massive improvement, there still are currently no known discrimination laws that mention sexual orientation or gender identity which allows for people, organizations, and companies to actively discriminate. Along with that, the Catholic Church has a large role in the political and social realms and has had a large impact on the laws and regulations against the LGBTQ+ community. However, this does not mean that all is lost as President Quesada has issued public apologies in regards to the past perceptions it had on LBGTQ+ people in Costa Rica and proudly supported and kept his stance on equal marriage.

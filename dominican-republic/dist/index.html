              value="In the Dominican Republic, there are ample amounts of violence and discrimination towards the LGBTQ+ community. This includes mass hate crimes, extortion by police, and unnecessary arrests towards the LGBTQ+ community. There have been reports that state nearly 75% of LGBTQ+ Dominicans have experienced discrimination. The reason the number is so high is that hate crimes are not written in law with sexual orientation and gender identity not being taken into account when investigating hate crimes or acts of discrimination. This means that if someone in the LGBTQ+ community is discriminated against, they cannot go to the police as they literally cannot do anything as LGBTQ+ discrimination is not illegal.

              value="It also should be mentioned that the policing bodies in the Dominican Republic often are complacent towards these situations which leave cases unsolved. LGBTQ+ individuals are banned from even working in the police sector as law 285-66 has made it illegal and punishable for up to 2 years in prison. Along with that, citizens are essentially protected when they actively discriminate as Article 186 protects people from discriminating through the bias of religious, ethical, or moral reasons. This means that a business owner can actively discriminate against someone for being gay and use the excuse of religious reasoning.

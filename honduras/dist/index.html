      <a-text color="red" value="As recently as January 28, 2021, Honduras Congress had approved its first reading regarding an amendment that would prohibit same-sex marriage is. As of 2005, there has been a constitutional amendment that prohibited the marriage between people of the same sex along with banning adoption by those couples. Honduran congress promotes what is essentially state-sponsored homophobia which attributes to its high levels of violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ plus community. There have been several attacks not only against individuals but actual organizations that fight for the rights and protections of LGBTQ plus people. These horrendous attacks and violence against the community need to be met with responses by the government that way these organizations that fight to protect LGBTQ plus rights protections may be able to continue their work to protect the rights of Hondurasâ€™ citizens." width="20" position="-9.5 1 -8" rotation="0 1 0"></a-text>

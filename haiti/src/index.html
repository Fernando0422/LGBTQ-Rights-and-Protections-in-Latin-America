The LGBTQ plus community in Haiti has experienced an increase in stigmatization and discrimination along with violence from anti-LGBTQ+ organizations. The Haitian society is deeply conservative and actively discriminated against the LGBTQ+ community leaving them to live in secrecy and isolation due to constant threat of violence, harassment, and discrimination from society and the government. The police force in Haiti provides a major source of violence, discrimination, and harassment towards the LGBTQ+ community, and getting away with this is having a government that does not protect the LGBTQ+ community.

Even judges actively discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community where they favor a perpetrator in any hate crimes or murders against LGBTQ+ individuals leaving the perpetrator to walk freely without receiving any punishment. Even in the medical field, people are continuously discriminated against due to the stigmatization of the LGBTQ+ community leaving many people afraid of seeking medical attention due to previous discrimination.
